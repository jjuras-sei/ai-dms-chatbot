# - existing_vpc_id must be a valid VPC ID
# - Must provide at least 2 public subnets in different availability zones
# - Must provide at least 2 private subnets in different availability zones
# - Public subnets should have internet gateway access for the ALB

# Set to true for private deployment (ALB in private subnets with VPC Link)
# Set to false (default) for public deployment (ALB in public subnets)
