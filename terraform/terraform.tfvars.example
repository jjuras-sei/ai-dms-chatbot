# Networking configuration (optional)
# By default, Terraform will create a new VPC with public and private subnets
# To use an existing VPC and subnets, uncomment and configure the following:

# existing_vpc_id = "vpc-xxxxxxxxx"
# existing_public_subnet_ids = ["subnet-xxxxxxxxx", "subnet-yyyyyyyyy"]
# existing_private_subnet_ids = ["subnet-zzzzzzzzz", "subnet-aaaaaaaaa"]

# Requirements when using existing VPC/subnets:
# - existing_vpc_id must be a valid VPC ID
# - Must provide at least 2 public subnets in different availability zones
# - Must provide at least 2 private subnets in different availability zones
# - Public subnets should have internet gateway access for the ALB

# Deployment mode (optional)
# Set to true for private deployment (ALB in private subnets with VPC Link)
# Set to false (default) for public deployment (ALB in public subnets)

# Set to true to make API Gateway only accessible from within VPC via VPC endpoint
# Requires enable_private_deployment = true
# When enabled, the public API Gateway endpoint is disabled

# Disable execute-api endpoint (optional)
# Controls whether the default execute-api endpoint is disabled
# When null (default), this will be set to the value of enable_private_api
# Set to true to force disable the endpoint, or false to force enable it
# This allows you to have enable_private_api = true with the endpoint still enabled
# disable_execute_api_endpoint = null

# Existing API Gateway VPC Endpoint (optional)
# Provide an existing VPC Endpoint ID for API Gateway (execute-api service)
# Only used when enable_private_api = true
# If not provided, a new VPC endpoint will be created
# Example: existing_api_gateway_vpc_endpoint_id = "vpce-0123456789abcdef0"
# existing_api_gateway_vpc_endpoint_id = ""
